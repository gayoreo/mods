#version 150

// T207. Temporal lattice resolve: four raw subpixel phases into one target of
// twice the phase resolution, plus the current frame's rain.
//
// One phase is marched per frame at a quarter-pixel screen-space offset
// (CloudTemporalPhaseState), so four consecutive phases place one ray at each
// of the 2x2 lattice sites a phase texel covers. This pass decides, per
// lattice pixel, which phase owns the site and fetches that phase's sample:
// the phase rendered this frame at zero bilinear fraction (the exact ray
// through this pixel), the other three reprojected ONCE from the camera each
// was rendered from, and validated against the CURRENT phase's evidence in
// the neighbourhood of the site. A history sample that fails falls back to
// the current phase's jitter-corrected bilinear reconstruction - this frame's
// own answer at shipped quality - never to stale content.
//
// Nothing here writes back into a phase. The phases are raw march output and
// only raw march output ever enters this pass (the T165 measurement: once-
// reprojected raw phases keep 62-84% of the stationary lattice gain; a
// recursively resampled accumulation buffer collapses it to 11%). The resolved
// target is consumed by the composite and by nothing temporal.
//
// Validity (T165's blocker was a point comparison between the depths of two
// DIFFERENT subpixel rays, which rejects exactly the thin structure the lattice
// recovers): a history sample is compared against the interval of answers the
// current phase gives in the 3x3 phase-texel neighbourhood of the site -
// coverage (alpha) and linear ray distance - carried through the same warp.
// Legitimate cross-ray disagreement lies inside that interval; content left
// over from before a real change (new sky, new cloud, a moved silhouette, a
// changed depth order) does not.
//
// Rain is the current frame's, always. A phase stores its body without the
// rain composite and, on its aux attachment, the body's accumulation and
// transmittance at the rain's depth; the rain texel of THIS frame is then
// composited at that point: A = before + T_before * R + T_r * (body - before),
// T = T_body * T_r - the in-march equation, so a stationary frame with rain
// reproduces the production composite exactly.
